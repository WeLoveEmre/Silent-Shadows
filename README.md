# Silent-Shadows
A simple (very broken) game I coded under 4 days, It has shit tone of bugs, But feel free to edit it or do something with it, not sure, And if you do have an fix for the enemies going to one spot on the right side, please do tell me, I've been working on that for the past 2 days now and it's annoying LOL
